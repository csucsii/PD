Prisoner's Dilemma Experiment
 
Player plays 7-round prisoner’s dilemma game against computer (computer chooses randomly between cooperate and cheat in every round):
If both cooperate, payoff = 2, 2
If both cheat, payoff = 0, 0
If one cheats and one cooperates, payoff = 3, -1 (respectively)

The game starts with short intro of the rules. Player needs to indicate his average payoff in the game (integer, min=-7, max=21). After every round, player’s score in the current round and cumulative score is displayed, and the player has to indicate his satisfaction (integer, min=1, max=10). After the last round of the game, player’s total score and opponent’s (computer) total score is displayed, and player needs to indicate his expected score integer, min=-7, max=21) if he was to play the game again.

Player randomly assigned to one of 3 groups before he starts the game: FREE, CHOICE, FORCE

FREE:
In all 7-rounds of the game, the player can freely choose whether to cooperate or cheat in the current round.

CHOICE:
After the introduction, player has to choose from 4 strategies. The steps (cooperate/cheat) are executed automatically in each round of the game according to the chosen strategy.

FORCE:
After the introduction, player is assigned to one of the 4 strategies. The steps (cooperate/cheat) are executed automatically in each round of the game according to the chosen strategy.

Strategies:
Nice-guy: cooperates in every round
Nasty-one: cheats in every round
Grudger: cooperates until opponent cheats, then cheats in every round thereafter Copycat: starts with cooperate, then copies the last move of the opponent

Statistics I’m interested in collecting:
Every group: Player’s expected payoff at the beginning and end of the game and player’s satisfaction score in every round of the game (so per player 2 expected scores and 7 satisfaction scores)
For group FREE: chosen steps in every round (cooperate/cheat)
For group CHOICE: chosen strategy label

Pages I would like to display:
Introduction: rules of the game
If player in CHOICE: 4 available strategies (with description) to choose from. Player has to choose one.
If player in FORCE: Description of randomly assigned strategy.
“Indicate your expected score at the end of the game!”
 7 pages for the 7 rounds of the game: game page, result page (current payoff and total payoff from all rounds), “How satisfied are you with your current level of payoff?”
Results page: player’s and opponent’s total score, plus questions: “Indicate your overall satisfaction with your score!” and “What would you expect your score to be if you were to play the game again?”
Thank you for your participation...
